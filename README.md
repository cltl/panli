# Perspective-Aware Natural Language Inference (PANLI) Dataset

> A benchmark dataset for studying natural language inference (NLI) with diverse human perspectives, based on real-world vaccination discourse.

The PANLI dataset is a natural language inference (NLI) benchmark consisting of premise-hypothesis pairs constructed from naturally occurring and independently authored texts extracted from the Vaccination Corpus. These pairs underwent only minimal automated post-processing, preserving their authenticity and reflecting real-world language use.

A key feature of the PANLI dataset is its perspective-aware design. Each premise-hypothesis pair receives at least one judgment from the author of the premise, and possibly one or more additional judgments from sources mentioned in the premise. These relative relationships between premises and hypotheses are referred to as *perspective units*.

The dataset is described in the following thesis:
