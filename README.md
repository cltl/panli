## Getting started

### pyenv
We recommend using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) to create a virtual environment for your Python version:

```console
pyenv install 3.11.7
pyenv local 3.11.7
```


### poetry
Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (version 1.7.1) and install all requirements from the `pyproject.toml` file:

```console
poetry install
```

Enter into a poetry shell using `poetry shell` or preface all following commands with `poetry run`.
